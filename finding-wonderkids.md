Finding future wonderkids

Again, a video by Evidence Based Football Manager (for FM22) is a major help. For [Manchester United](https://youtu.be/R5Q5qREwYtI?t=847), players are given a 1* ability if their CA is around 80, 1.5* if their CA is around 100 and 2* if their CA is around 120. 
The [benchmarks set by EBFM](https://youtu.be/R5Q5qREwYtI?t=770) mean that a 15 y/o needs to be at least 1*, a 17 y/o needs to be at least 1.5* and a 19 y/o needs to be at least 2*. This all makes sense.
