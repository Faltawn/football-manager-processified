## Talent development
### Recruitment and managing playing time
This deviates a little bit from the guide by SFraser. However, the main point stands: it is important to have a plan for youngsters once you recruit them either via youth intake or via transfers. I do not have an issue stuffing my B team with older players with good personalities who (~~hardly~~ ~~ever~~) never play a game. In particular, there are (should be) enough tutors available for every youngster at any given time. (The contract negotiations for that many players is a bit annoying, though. Maybe you can delegate that to the Director of Football.) Hence, alternating loan spells and tutoring spells is not necessary and I think this gives players the most time to develop their CA by going on loan.

The idea of the recruitment/development is as follows:
- Buy high potential players as young as possible
- Loan them out in the last window before they turn 20: CA gain seems to decelarate afterwards (see p. 3 of [Pattern_of_player_growth_in_FM23.pdf](https://github.com/Faltawn/football-manager-processified/files/11814988/Pattern_of_player_growth_in_FM23.pdf))
- Let them stay in your youth team for two years
	- This way, they will be flagged as U21 once they return from loan
	- According to some help tip, players under a certain age (I think 18 and younger) gain the most from training (unsure if this is really true), and they might as well be in the best training facilities possible.

		- This might make it beneficial to have the most talented youth players in your first team while playing games for your U19s. Also, you may be more inclined to select these players for matches when they are visible in your first team, but it might clutter the player selection screen. Maybe keep the most talented ones in your first team and make sure you do not need to scroll.
- For example, when players are bought at age 16, they will be 18/19 after being in your youth team for two years. They can now leave for one/two loan spells where they get a lot of playing time and develop that way. By being tutored from a young age, these youngsters will also have a good personality, which improves the rate at which they gain current ability (CA).
- You do not need players to be good right now, especially if they are not at your club. You want them to be good once they return from loan (although playing well on loan might accelerate the CA gain) or when they are old enough.
  
### Different phases
I think it is important to realize that as your team (hopefully) becomes better, it becomes harder to (easily) find players that strengthen your first team. It becomes even harder to find young(er) players that slot straight into your starting eleven. In particular, it is very unlikely to find an 18-year-old starter once your team pushes for the latter stages of the Champions League.
As long as your team is not pushing for the latter stages of the Champions League, recruiting young players is not so important and youth intakes may already be enough
 to stuff the youth team. This is also because the star rating is based on the current ability of your first team, which may not be that high. Youngsters that appeared to be superstars could turn out to be just okay instead of worldbeaters.
It is also important to realize that it is not possible to develop all players into stars. It also depends on luck.
To reflect your team getting better, I suggest changing the thresholds for good/excellent attributes every now and then (every season for definiteness: set a calendar reminder). As mentioned by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779dOtmg5A4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779dOtmg5A4) Second Yellow Card, this allows you to set up views and simply scout on the number of 'excellent' attributes that you see.

### Further suggestions
Maybe you should not stuff your entire U19 full of players (just ones that might be very good), because otherwise they will not play games. They probably need it to develop.
Loan the lesser ones out (or release them) to give your best talents the playing time? I do not know how much this affects CA gain.
To test CA gain, you need the editor: it could be interesting to buy it for a new version.
Use different views with adjusted thresholds for attributes to find talented players.

### Loans as a tool
Loans are a nice, non-permanent way of getting rid of players. Reasons can vary, but a non-complete list is
- squad bloat
- getting regular match experience
- earning money
- earning homegrown nation status with a domestic loan
